          I've been interested in the seldom seen aspects of life since I was
          young. I wanted to see something no one has seen and go where no one
          has gone. When I grew up my scope changed, but my desire to see the
          unseen never really left me. I found that wildlife and landscape
          offered moments that living in the suburban and urban sprawl could
          never give. From seeing the iris of an alligator to photographing the
          core of the Milky Way, there are incredible things to see, and I do my
          best to share them. I hope you enjoy what you've seen, and if you want
          to reach out, feel free to swing over to the contact page. I'm always
          willing to share knowledge and swap stories. Thanks for stopping by,
          and I hope you've seen something you liked.
